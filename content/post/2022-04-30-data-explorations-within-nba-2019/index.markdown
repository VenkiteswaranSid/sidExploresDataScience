## Context Behind Data:
  This data set contains the outcomes of every game in the 2019 NBA regular season. The information contained in this data set would be particularly useful to the front offices of each NBA team, as it contains valuable information and trends on some major statistics like points scored by a team, field goal percentage by a team, etc. The trends observed from this could prove useful to teams by providing them which areas they need to improve upon.
  The population of interest in this data set is all the games played in the 2019 season. The observational unit in this data set is a game. The majority of the variables in this data set are quantitative, with a few exceptions. Game location, opponent, game outcome, date, and team name, are all categorical variables. Specifically, game location and game outcome are categorical binary variables.

## data:  FT_percent_team by Game_Outcome
## t = -3.3643, df = 1045.1, p-value = 0.0007953
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group L and group W is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -0.033346966 -0.008777645
## sample estimates:
## mean in group L mean in group W 
##       0.7580201       0.7790824
```

By looking at the distribution of the data from the density plot and the violin plot, the data for free throw percentage in wins is more concentrated in the area from 50% to 100% while the free throw percentage in losses is more spread out. We can also look at the p value in the model, which is 0.000968. This is a relatively small number, which means that there is some evidence to reject the hypothesis our null hypothesis of the mean free throw percentage being the same across wins and losses. The reason for this distribution of data might be because in games that teams lose, they may not be taking full advantage of the free points at the free throw line, which leads to them not being able to keep up with teams that score more points. 






## Question 2: Does the number of steals and turnovers predict the team score?

```r

```

 
There appears to be no linear relationship between the amount of steals and turnovers compared to the amount of points scored. Evidence for this can be seen in the p values for the intercept, turnovers for team, and steals for team in the summary of the model. All three p values are very small, which means that there is a lot of evidence available to reject the notion that there is a linear relationship present. In addition to the p value, we can see that there isn't a linear relationship by looking at the plot of the data. There is no clear association between the three variables as they are all scattered around. The reason for this might be because while steals and turnovers can impact a basketball game and whether a team wins or not, they do not have much of an effect on the team score. For example, if a team manages to get a lot of steals, but fails to score the ball off of those steals, the team score won't be affected very much. 


## Question 3: If the number of field goals attempted by a team increases, does the number of offensive rebounds also increase?

```r

There appears to be a positive association between the number of field goals attempted and offensive rebounds. That is, as the number of field goals attempted increases, the number of offensive rebounds increases too. This could be explained by the fact that as the amount of field goals attempted increases, there are more chances for the shot to be off target. This results in more chances to grab an offensive rebound during a game. There is also a lot of variance within this data set, as is shown by the distribution of the data points in the scatterplot and the multiple r squared value, which is 29.83%. The 29.83% is the proportion of variability that can be explained by the model, which shows that there is a lot of variability in the model that is left unexplained.

```
There appears to be a negative association between the number of turnovers and the field goals attempted. This can be seen in the graph of the data, where the line of best fit shows that as turnovers increase, the number of field goals decrease. Additionally, the correlation value for the two variables lies at -0.3187027, which indicates that there is a negative association because the value is less than zero. However, this association is not very strong. This can be attributed to the fact that if a team turns the ball over, they waste a possession and a chance to take a shot at the basket. There is some variance in this data set, which can be seen in the multiple R squared value, which lies at 10.16%. 


## Question 5: If teams have more assists, do they score more points in a game?

There is a positive association between the assists a team has and the points that they score. This is evidenced by the distribution of the data in the graph and the correlation between the two variables. The correlation value is 0.5490799, which is close to 1. This means that there is a strong positive association between the two variables. Additionally, the slope of the graph is positive, which means that a positive association is present. This can be attributed to the fact that in order to get an assist, the player who receives a pass must score the ball. As a result, as teams get more assists, that means that they are able to put the ball in the basket more, which leads to them scoring more points in games.
