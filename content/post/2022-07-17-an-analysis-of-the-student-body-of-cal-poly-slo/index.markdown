## Background
This is a web application I created in order to take a look at where the student body of Cal Poly SLO comes from, within the state of California. There are 3 options which the user can use to filter the dataset by to get a better look at the trends that are present within the dataset. The first is selecting by all high schools in California. The second option is to filter by region. The regions contain many different counties, and it allows the user to take a closer look at the data than they would be able to by selecting by all the high schools in California. The third option the user has is to select by county. This allows for the most specificity when parsing through the data. Some counties are larger than others, so they will have more samples present than others. Additionally, the user has the ability to choose which variables they use in the plot. The options are application, admission, and enrollment. I hope this plot is helpful to anyone using it.
